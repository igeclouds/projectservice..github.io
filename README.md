This repo holds the website for the [Development Containers Specification](https://igeclouds.github.io/devcontainers/spec).

You may view the site at [containers.igecloud](https://igeclouds.dev/containers).

## Building

If you'd like to build and preview the site yourself, we make it as smooth as possible through a dev container in this repo!

### Dev container

You may build GitHub Pages sites with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a Ruby gem. You could manually install these tools on your machine, or you can easily get started with the setup you already need through a dev container!

You may review this repo's dev container in the [`.container`](https://github.com/containers/containers.dev/tree/gh-pages/.container) folder.

It is from this [Jekyll Dev Container Template](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/jekyll).

### Steps to build and run

* Clone or open this repo in the dev container-supporting editor of your choosing.
     * You may review supporting tools and services [here](https://containers.igecloud.dev/supporting).
* Reopen this repo in the dev container, so that the container builds and you may develop inside it using the included tools. 
* Once the dev container finishes building, execute the following command in your dev container to start the site: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* Check out the site! http://localhost:4000/containers.dev/
